# The problem:

![DLF%207c4f6fc5318444c3aa4e25194497a546/Untitled%201.png](DLF%207c4f6fc5318444c3aa4e25194497a546/Untitled%201.png)

- We love food from DLF, and most of the time we crave it at the end of a long day during all-nighters we pull. So the problem arrives, who is willing to go?
- Not everyone wants to travel all the way outside to DLF just for a Shawarma.
- **"Koi DLF pe hai kya?"** This is something that has a constant presence at night on WhatsApp group chats.
- It is common that people bring food for others staying back at hostel as a "social service".
- So why not make this process easier?

# The solution:

- The solution we end up using is as mentioned before, WhatsApp groups. Or we just tell the dude going to DLF to bring a snack or two for ourselves.
- The person staying at the hostel is happy, the person bringing food does not mind since they hope, that one day when they want to stay back, they too can get food from DLF.
- This solution works..Just like a shitty webpage without a proper backend, hence more often than not we end up not hungry with misplaced orders and hungry, finding someone bringing food because of the communication problem is a hard task.

So Why will WhatsApp not work at times? Not everyone checks WhatsApp all the time. Your request for someone at DLF might get lost in history in a matter of seconds.

Also, if you are bringing food for multiple people there is a chance you miss someone's order due to multiple messaging platforms and chats.

So now, how do we fix this without complicating things?

# The better solution:

- We present to you an idea, for a more convenient way to get food from DLF.
- @DLF? is a platform for you to know who's at DLF.
- If you know someone who's currently at DLF, you can finally eat your Tava bonda which you have been craving for hours.

# The basic idea

- The person who wants to order the food puts the order details, regarding the quantity and the items.
- **Delivery friendly:** The person @DLF does not need to reveal their identity until they accept the order.
- This summarizes the basic idea, it's just an app to announce your order and communicate with the people currently at DLF. although it has more potential in the future.

# Potential features

- **Order receiving and delivering option.** You get to communicate about the order and delivery location via the app itself instead of a third-party app.
- **Payment options.** communicate about the bill, have the app redirect you to direct payment through UPI or splits.
- **Shop updates.** people @DLF could update the details about the availability of the food from the open shops.
- **Browse orders.** the ability to browse through the orders and choose what to deliver at your convenience.
- Potential **live tracking** of the order, the delivery person could keep you updated about your order status.
